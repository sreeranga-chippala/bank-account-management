# 🏦 Bank Account Management System (Python OOP Project)

This project is a simple **Bank Account Management System** built using **Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking their balance.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the real-world application of **OOP principles** in Python.  
It uses **classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation** to simulate a mini bank system for a single user.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Check balance  
- Exit the program  
- Simple and user-friendly interface  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- OOP (Classes, Methods, Objects)  
- Loops and Conditionals  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sreeranga-chippala/bank-account-system.git
2.Open the folder in your code editor
3.Run the file

🧾 Sample Output:-
Enter the name of the person: Ram
Enter initial balance: 1000

Select the choice:
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Check Balance
4. Exit

Enter your choice (1-4): 1
Enter amount to deposit: 500
Balance after deposit of 500.0 is 1500.0

Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): no
Session closed. Have a great day!
